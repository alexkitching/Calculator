**1st Year University Project** <br/>
**Semester 2** <br/>
**Programming Fundamentals**

For this assignment I was tasked with creating a calculator using C++ and windows forms.
The calculator was to make use of reverse polish notation and account for advanced mathematical operations required from a calculator.

**Features** <br/>
Support for Simple Calculation Functions (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division) <br/>
Support for Advanced Calculation Functions (Modulus, Square Root, Squared, Powers, Inverse) <br/>
Decimal and Negative Number Handling <br/>
Memory Functions <br/>
Reverse Polish Notation used for Calculation <br/>

**Skills Demonstrated** <br/>
Working with Windows Forms <br/>
C++ Knowledge (Data Structure use e.g Stack, Vector) <br/>
Recursion <br/>
Unit Testing <br/>
